# How It Works

## Overview

The HeyGen TypeScript SDK provides a type-safe interface to HeyGen's AI video generation and interactive avatar services. It consists of three main packages:

1. Core SDK (`@teamduality/heygen-sdk`)
2. Streaming SDK (`@teamduality/og-streaming-sdk`)
3. Demo Application (`@teamduality/og-next-demo`)

## Architecture

The SDK is built with a modular architecture:

- Core SDK handles all base API interactions
- Streaming SDK extends core functionality for real-time avatar interactions
- Demo app showcases integration patterns

## Integration Flow

1. Initialize the SDK with your API key
2. Create videos or start streaming sessions
3. Handle responses with full TypeScript support
4. Manage resources and cleanup

## Code Example

<Callout type="info">
  Currently we're utilizing the original streaming SDK. Check out our
  [roadmap](/project/roadmap) for more information on how we're planning to
  expand on this.
</Callout>

```typescript
import { HeygenSDK } from '@teamduality/heygen-sdk'
import { StreamingAvatar } from '@teamduality/og-streaming-sdk'

// Initialize core SDK
const sdk = new HeygenSDK('your_api_key')

// Create a streaming avatar
const avatar = new StreamingAvatar({
  token: 'your_token'
})

// Start an interactive session
await avatar.createStartAvatar({
  quality: 'medium',
  avatarName: 'your_avatar'
})
```
